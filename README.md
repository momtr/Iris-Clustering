# Iris-Clustering
Clustering of Iris dataset (K-Means) without PCA

## Dataset
"The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters."
(*Wikipedia*, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)

## Output
There are three classes contained in the dataset (each 50 elements).
The model (k = 3) creates three clusters, each with about 50 elements (predictions were also pretty good)!
